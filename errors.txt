Application crashed when trying to show a dialog box.

During setup of the dialog box, as context we passed the return value from getBaseContext(). To get it working, we instead passed passed it the current activity (this).


Episodes not showing

Channel adapter did not pass the actual episodes to super class. and was set to wrong generic class.

public class ChannelAdapter extends ArrayAdapter<Channel> {
	private Channel chData;
	private Context context;

	public ChannelAdapter(Context context, Channel objects) {
		super(context, R.layout.file_list_item);
		this.chData = objects;
		this.context = context;
	}
